WHAT FILES ARE WHAT?
'CDS 301 Final (1).pdf' contains my bakcground for project, literature review, data-preprocessing steps, and resulted word clouds and bar graphs.
'graphsmrbeast.R' is where I created all of my graphs
'mrbeast_titles.txt' is where all of Mr. Beast's YouTube titles (730 videos, updated 11/24/22)
'mrbeastdata.R' is where I got the YouTube analytics of Mr. Beast's channel using an API key.
'top10vid_titles.txt' is where all of Mr. Beast's top 10 best performing YouTube titles are (updated 11/24/22)
'upload.csv' contains Mr. Beast's Youtube analytics: video likes, comments, views, titles, description, id, and other stuff. (8 columns, 730 rows) If you want more information than that, then you can change a few lines within 'mrbeastdata.R' [check comments]
